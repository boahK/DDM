Implementation
===============
A PyTorch implementation of deep-learning-based model.
* Requirements
  * OS : Ubuntu / Windows
  * Python 3.6
  * PyTorch 1.4.0

Dataset
===============
* In our experiment, we used 4D cardiac MR scans provided by the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC). 
* You can download the data at [ACDC](https://acdc.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/description/databases.html).
* In our experiment, we resampled all MRI scans with a voxel spacing of 1.5 x 1.5 x 3.15 mm, and saved the data with .mat.
* Examples of the data we used can be downloaded at [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1G0i9YI0qY3GXq4tUqFn6OeQKvMuRX69q?usp=sharing).
   * Copy downloaded directory of "ACDC_dataset" to './data'.
   * The data in the directory "data_ED_ES" have 3D MR scans at the end diastolic and at the end systolic phases, and their corresponding segmentation labels.
   * The data in the directory "data_ED2ES" have 4D MR scans from the end diastolic to the end systolic phases, which is used in the test stage.

Training
===============
* DDM_train.py is the implementation code for training the proposed diffusion deformable model.
* You can run the code through "sh train.sh" in terminal.
* All parameter settings we used are written in ./config/DDM_train.json file.

Evaluation
===============
* DDM_test.py is the implementation code of inference for 4D temporal image generation. 
* You can run the code by running "sh test.sh" in terminal.
